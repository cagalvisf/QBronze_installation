# QBronze installation session

In this repository you will find a guide for installing all the necessary software needed for the development of the QBronze workshop offered by Qcolombia with help of the organization Qworld. Since there are english and spanish speakers in the audience we developed and [english](https://github.com/cagalvisf/QBronze_installation/blob/main/Installation_session_english.ipynb) and [spanish](https://github.com/cagalvisf/QBronze_installation/blob/main/Installation_session_spanish.ipynb) version of this guide. You can visualize them here.

If you cannot visualize this you could install the python distribution called Anaconda from their official [website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). The installation will be slightly different depending on the operating system you are working on.

* Windows: After downloading you just have to execute the `.exe` file. Then, accept the terms and conditions and follow the steps to complete the installation.
* Linux: The download will give you a `.sh` file. Once you have this file, open a terminal in the directory where the file is located and execute the line `bash Nombre_del_archivo.sh`. For example, with the current version of Anaconda, you would have to execute the line `bash Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh`.
* MacOS: After downloading you just have to execute the `.pkg` file. Then, accept the terms and conditions and follow the steps to complete the installation.

You can also see a [pdf document](https://gitlab.com/qworld/bronze-qiskit/-/blob/master/installation.pdf) that could be helpful in your installation process.
